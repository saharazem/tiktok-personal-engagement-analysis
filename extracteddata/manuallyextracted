### Manually Extracted Data
Due to limitations with TikTok's API, some data was manually collected and stored in the `/manually_extracted_data` folder:
- **manual_liked_videos_updated.csv:** Contains manually added data for liked videos, including detailed hashtags and themes.
- **manual_posted_videos.xlsx:** Stores metadata for personal TikTok posts, such as timestamps, captions, and associated hashtags.

These files provide supplementary insights for the analysis where API limitations and difficulties were encountered.
