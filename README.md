# TikTok Engagement Analysis vs Personal Posting Behavior

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between my TikTok engagement habits—such as browsing, liking videos, saving sounds, and following trends—and my personal posting behavior on the platform. The goal is to analyze patterns in engagement and posting to uncover correlations and insights into how social media influences creative output.

## Hypothesis
The hypothesis of this project is that my engagement habits on TikTok directly influence the themes, styles, and creative decisions in my personal posts.

## Scope of the Project
- **Data Overview:**
  - The dataset includes my TikTok activity data, such as browsing history, liked videos, favorite sounds, personal posts, and profile information.
- **Analysis:**
  - Focused on trends in posting behavior, engagement data, and the relationship between them.
  - Explored how browsing habits and saved sounds influence posting patterns.
- **Visualization:**
  - Created graphs and charts to present insights into posting trends, sound usage, and engagement patterns.
- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square) were used to evaluate correlations between engagement habits and posting behavior.

## Tools and Techniques
- Python scripts were used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook was utilized for organizing code and generating graphs.

## Deliverables
- **Full Report:** Detailed analysis, findings, and conclusions are documented in [DSA210 ProjectReport.pdf](./DSA210_ProjectReport.pdf).
- **Code and Visualizations:** All Python code and generated graphs can be found in [DSA210ProjeFinal.ipynb](./DSA210ProjeFinal.ipynb).

## Conclusion
This project highlights how my engagement with TikTok content impacts my creative output on the platform. While the results supported some aspects of the hypothesis, they also revealed additional factors influencing my posting behavior. 

## Limitations
The analysis faced challenges due to TikTok API restrictions, requiring manual data extraction for some categories (e.g., hashtags and favorite sounds). Future work can focus on using advanced data collection methods for improved accuracy.
