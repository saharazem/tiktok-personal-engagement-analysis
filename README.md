# TikTok Engagement and Personal Posting Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates the influence of TikTok engagement—likes, favorites, sounds, and follows—on personal posting behavior. By analyzing trends, themes, and patterns in engagement data, the goal is to understand if and how my content consumption shapes my creative output on TikTok.

### Main Hypothesis

**"The content I engage with on TikTok (e.g., liked videos, saved sounds) directly influences the themes, styles, and creative decisions in my personal TikTok posts."**

## Dataset Description

The project uses personal data exported from TikTok, organized into the following key categories:

### 1. **Activity Data**
- **Browsing History**: Tracks the videos I’ve watched.
- **Searches**: Keywords and phrases searched on TikTok.
- **Share History**: Details content shared with others.

### 2. **Engagement Data**
- **Liked Videos**: Content I’ve liked, highlighting trends and interests.
- **Favorite Videos**: Videos saved as favorites, offering deeper insights into personal preferences.
- **Favorite Sounds**: Saved audio tracks, showcasing recurring audio trends or themes.

### 3. **Personal Posts**
- **Posted Content**: Metadata about my posts, including captions, themes, and sounds used.
- **Deleted Posts**: Tracks removed posts to identify changes in creative direction.

### 4. **Profile Data**
- **Following**: Accounts I follow, reflecting influencers or creators that resonate with me.
- **Followers**: Insights into my TikTok network.

## Project Idea and Plan

### Objective
To identify and analyze the relationship between my TikTok engagement habits and personal posting behavior.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Organize the exported TikTok dataset into relevant categories.
- Clean and preprocess the data:
  - Remove duplicates.
  - Standardize formats for descriptions, hashtags, and metadata.

#### Step 2: Data Analysis
- Explore engagement data for trends and themes in liked/favorite videos and saved sounds.
- Categorize personal posts by themes, sound usage, and creative styles.
- Compare patterns between engagement data and personal posting behavior.

#### Step 3: Visualization
- Create charts and graphs to present findings:
  - Distribution of themes in engagement and personal posts.
  - Frequency of sound usage in personal posts.
  - Trends in posting behavior over time.

#### Step 4: Insights and Hypothesis Testing
- Test the hypothesis:
  - Evaluate overlaps between themes in engagement data and personal posts.
  - Analyze the percentage of personal posts using favorite sounds.
  - Measure temporal alignment between engagement and posting habits.

#### Step 5: Conclusions and Future Work
- Summarize findings and their implications for creative behavior.
- Propose directions for extended analysis or application of insights.
